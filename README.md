## Expirimental Learning

### Cumlative Verse

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/79RJtYW/Screenshot-2025-05-12-143739.png" alt="12Days"></a>
> A program which properly generates the lyrics to *"The Twelve Days of Christmas"* in sequential order, including correct grammar in the fixed format.

     //"if the item is 0 (Partridge) and the day is greater than 1 (1st day of Christmas)"
    if (item == 0 && day > 1)
            Console.WriteLine("and " + items[item] + "."); //it's the Partridge line and requires an "and" and "."
    else
            Console.WriteLine(items[item] + (item == 0 ? "." : ",")); //"?" if the item is 0 place "." else place ","

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args) 
        {
            int height = 12; //pyramid height
    
            for (int i = 1; i <= height; i++) //outer loop
            {
                //increasing - between * each row down
                for (int j = 1; j <= height - i; j++)
                {
                    Console.Write("-");
                }
    
                //increase * by one
                for (int k = 1; k <= (2 * i - 1); k++)
                {
                    Console.Write("*");
                }
    
                //next line
                Console.WriteLine();
            }
        }
    }
